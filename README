1. Clone the project
2. Run the individual services
3. Call the url http://localhost:8040/api/users/userdetails/1  to get userStatistics
4. Call the url http://localhost:8041/api/users/1 to get Users
5. This is a very simple service that demonstrates the workings of CB and retry pattern implementations
   of Resilience4j, a light weight fault tolerance library. Hence, there are no implementations of
   exception handling or even the typical microservice features like service registry, config servers
   etc.

   Note: I chose Resilience4j library over Hystrix library for Handling failures and latency because
    Resilience4j offers active development, modularity, extensibility, integration with Java 8 features,
    lightweight and low overhead, and support for non-blocking and reactive programming styles
